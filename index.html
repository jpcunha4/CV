        <p><em>Student of Web Development at <strong><a href="http://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a web development student right now, but I've done some things in the past.
          Strating by the beginning of my development carrer, in 2013, I begun my Computer Science
          Degree at UniCEUB, at Taguatinga, Distrito Federal. During my graduation I had a really cool
          experience programming with Object-C and Swift at BEPiD, at Católica University, a program
          focused on teach mobile development to graduating students and encourge them to be an
          entreprenuer. It was a 2 year course that made way better at programming. I finished my
          Graduation by December/2016, but I haven't started working in the area yet. For a year
          and a half, I work as an English Intructor. It was a great experience that tought me how
          to deal better with people. But that wasn't quite what I wanted so, after being fired, I
          decided to study hard to get back to the area. That's were I'm now and I hope I can become a
          really great developer in my life.</p>
